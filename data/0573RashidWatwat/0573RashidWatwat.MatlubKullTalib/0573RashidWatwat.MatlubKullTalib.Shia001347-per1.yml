90#VERS#COMMENT##: The editor states that this edition was made based 
    on an (undefined) manuscript, and compared with a photograph of ms. 
    Kitābkhāneh markazī dānishgāh Tehran no. 707. 
    PV removed the short editorial introduction at the start, 
    added headers for each of the 100 kalimāt,
    and replaced Arabic kāfs and yāʾs with Persian ones.
    The text sometimes contains gāf instead of kāf.
